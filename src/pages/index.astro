      Hi, I'm Chizi — a software developer and design engineer based in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
      <br /><br />
      I solve unique business problems for startups and business owners in finance and commerce. My projects
      are often focused on design systems, accessibility, typography, and animations.
      <br /><br />
      Currently, I work with founders and business owners looking to build and scale their ideas with
      software solutions. If that sounds like you, <Contact client:load>let's connect!</Contact>
